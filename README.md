This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for
documentation and release notes.

## Helpers
Active:
* **TiledConfigs** contains example projects that will configure Stardew tile sets in a way that you can quickly make use of Tiled features such as TerrainBrush and AutoMap.  I hope these will improve your map making experience when making stardew mods.  After the list grows a bit I will compile a master project that uses all of the example features, which you can use as a starting template.  I'm trying to do the configuration so you won't have to, or if you want to do your own configuration, you can reference these.
  * Ground type transitions to just handle them selves - if you have configured Terrain Brushes...
  * Grass can be randomized - if you have configured an AutoMap...
  * The bottom of walls can end-cap themselves - if you have configured Terrain Brushes...
  * The walls can automatically draw based on where yo placed the bottom , and onto the correct layers - if you have configured an AutoMap...
  * Trees (and buildings) can automatically draw based on where you placed the bottom, and onto the correct layers - if you have configured an AutoMap...
  * Ground types can make correct walking sounds - if the tile properties are set correctly.
  * Bridges also require tile properties to work correctly.
  * Tiled also supports custom property types, so I might be able to have contextual property menus that indicate what properties SMAPI looks for.

  You found a new tool.  The owners manual indicates it is a "Unlicensed Nuclear Accelerator" made in "SoFar"  Maru says it works like a cyclotron, but you're pretty sure it works like a 2-in-1 cordless leafblower & vacuum.
